## Description of project (spec / MVP)

The main task was to create a portfolio to showcase what I would be learning on the course and to give the visitors an insight to who I am. I practiced using GitHub, HTML & SCSS. I also practiced to develop responsive design so my portfolio can be open on different devices.

This portfolio has the following sections:

- My name and title
- A little bit about you
- A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs I have learned during the course
- A Project page/section with all my projects
- My email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

## Reflection

This is my first project that I completed during the \_Nology program.

## Future Goals

- Rebuild the portfolio with React
- Replace icons with icons from the libraries (https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- Add headings for skill categories
- Update stying and add interactivity (e.g. collapsible project cards)
- Add "Download CV" option
